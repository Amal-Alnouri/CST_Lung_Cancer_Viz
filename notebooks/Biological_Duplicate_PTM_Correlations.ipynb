    "## Non-reproducible Systematic Variation in Cell Line Data\n",
    "Of the 45 cell lines measured in the PTM experimental data three cell lines are duplicated - resulting in 42 unique cell lines. We showed in a different notebook that the PTM distributions (measuring ~4000 PTMs for each cell line) showed systematic variation that was unlikely to be biological in nature. Furthermore, we showed that biological replicate experiments showed a non-reproducible systematic variation, which further indicates that this variation is not biological. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Normalization Method and Gene-Expression Validation \n",
    "We proposed that we correct for this variation using cell-line quantile normalization to enforce that the cell lines have the same distributions. However, this normalization might also introduce other problems and reduce the overall quality of the data. In a different notebook, we showed that cell line quantile normalization (as well as quantile normalization followed by PTM Z-score normalization) improved the correlation of cell-line/cell-line distances in gene-expression-space and PTM-space. In other words normalization of the PTM data improved the similarity of how cell lines are arranged in the two spaces (gene-expression and PTM) where we expect the cell lines to behave similarly in both spaces. \n",
