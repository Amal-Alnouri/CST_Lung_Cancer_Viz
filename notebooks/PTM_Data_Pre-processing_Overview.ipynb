    "The script `make_CCLE_comparable_matrix.py` combines all PTM data types (phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation) into a single tsv file. Then it averages duplicate measurements of cell lines (some cell lines were measured in two different plexes). Finally, it saves a tsv file with only the 37 cell lines that were found in the CCLE data. "
